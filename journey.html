					<blockquote>I am very progressive when it comes to building websites and I strive to use better techniques each time I create.</blockquote>
					<p>I studied web design at the Art Institute of Orange County in CA., where I learned how to implement hierarchy, typography, grids, imagery, and wireframes, for creating company branding, e-commerce sites, thoughtful user experience & interaction, and functional interfaces. These skills led me to my first Front End Developer job at Insteo, a digital signage company.</p>
					<p>At Insteo, I worked as the main developer for creating their customizable web applications. I created a variety of interactive web applications that were used in websites, events, restaurants, hotels and stores.</p>
					<p>I am very progressive when it comes to building websites and I strive to use better techniques each time I create.</p>
					<p>I decided to pursue my dreams further and expand my knowledge in the developing side of websites. I attended the Coding Dojo a 12 Week Bootcamp for learning 3 full stacks of web development. It is one of the best decisions I've ever made for myself. Weeks of morning algorithms and learning new technologies has broadened my idea of what it takes to fully create a website application.</p>
					<h4 class="center-align light-green-text text-darken-2">WHO I'VE BECOME</h4>
					<blockquote>I program with a better mindset for making my code understandable, maintainable for others, and follow customary web techniques.</blockquote>
					<p>My experience in learning web development has given me the ability to see the bigger picture when I create a website. Previously my coding world was html, css, javascript, jquery, php and mysql, but now I can view them as parts of a LAMP stack application. I have more knowledge of different web frameworks and how they can be implemented to jumpstart an application.</p>
					<p>I have a greater understanding of how MVC's work and why they exist.</p>
					<p>I am thankful for things like GitHub, StackOverflow, CodePen, JSBin, NPM, and any number of frameworks and libraries you can find. It has given me much more appreciation for programmers, designers, and the field of web. I program with a better mindset for making my code understandable, maintainable for others, and follow customary web techniques.</p> 
					<p>Practicality and ease is reflected through my programming. We shouldn't always feel compelled to reinvent the wheel, but we should work together and use the great wheels others have created as a foundation for a brand new product. All of these ideas have driven me to become a much more refined and resourceful web developer.</p>
					<h4 class="center-align light-green-text text-darken-2">LOOKING FORWARD</h4>
					<blockquote>I see myself bridging the gap between the designer and the programmer.</blockquote>
					<p>I look at my future with a big grin. Excited to meet and work with other programmers, designers, and directors. Eager to discover what new trends and technologies I should know and learn. My appetite for learning new languages has grown. I see myself bridging the gap between the designer and the programmer. I look forward to transcending my skills within a company and get a feel about the business side of web development. I am ready to further my career and some day become Chief Technology Officer of a big company.</p>
