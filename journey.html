					<blockquote>I am very progressive when it comes to building websites and I strive to use better techniques each time I create.</blockquote>
					<p>My interest for web design began in high school where I would constantly customize online blogs and myspace sites. I've always had a natural eye for noticing creative visual communication which has led me to discover my skills in art design through a variety of techniques.</p>
					<p>I studied web design at the Art Institute of Orange County in CA., where I learned how to implement hierarchy, typography, grids, imagery, and wireframes, for creating company branding, e-commerce sites, thoughtful user experience & interaction, and functional interfaces. These skills led me to my first Front End Developer job at Insteo, a digital signage company.</p>
					<p>At Insteo, I worked as the main developer for creating their customizable web applications. I created a variety of interactive web applications that were used in websites, events, restaurants, hotels and stores.</p>
					<p>I am very progressive when it comes to building websites and I strive to use better techniques each time I create.</p>
					<p>I decided to pursue my dreams further and expand my knowledge in the developing side of websites. I attended the Coding Dojo in March of 2015 where I solidified my knowledge in creating an entire website from front to back.</p>
					<p>The Coding Dojo is a 12 Week Bootcamp for learning 3 full stacks of web development. It is one of the best decisions I've ever made for myself. Weeks of morning algorithms and learning new technologies has broadened my idea of what it takes to fully create a website application.</p>
					<h4>WHO I'VE BECOME</h4>
					<p>My experience in learning web development has given me the ability to see the bigger picture when I create a website. Previously my coding world was html, css, javascript, jquery, php and mysql, but now I can view them as parts of a LAMP stack application. I have more knowledge of different web frameworks and how they can be implemented to jumpstart an application. I can deliver you a website quickly on Ruby on Rails, give you a site built in the MEAN stack which can offer you a more real-time experience with the use of socket.io, or I can research and learn a new framework that might be more fitting for your application. Frameworks not only for back end development, but front end such as Bootstrap or Materialize can be used to help achieve a more unified design and have it work responsively.</p>
					<p>I have a greater understanding of how MVC's work and why they exist.</p>
					<p>I am thankful for things like GitHub, StackOverflow, CodePen, JSBin, NPM, and any number of frameworks and libraries you can find. It has given me much more appreciation for programmers, designers, and the field of web. I program with a better mindset for making my code understandable, maintainable for others, and follow customary web techniques.</p> 
					<p>Because of my new knowledge, I have started to program with functionality first and then rework the design afterwards. Using a more methodical approach, we can build the basic functionalities of a web application and use this as a foundation. We can then test the website and take a step back and make edits to the functionalities. In this way, we can at least have a working foundation and we are able to see all the pieces of the project and decide if they fit, if we are missing something, or if there is a better solution. We can tailor the design to create the right experience to generate more attraction.</p>
					<p>I have grown as a designer to believe in the idea of practicality and ease; for me, this idea serves as a basis for creating a functional web experience that serves the user and requires user interaction only when completely necessary but must also be completely easy. I also love minimalism and high resolution images, especially free ones. I also think there's a certain charm to flat design but because it's becoming a trend, at some point you would need to consider an update. I've learned to sacrifice for time constraints and not to be too afraid to replicate. Familiarity builds trust and can strengthen the overall user experience.</p>
					<p>Practicality and ease is also reflected through my programming. We shouldn't always feel compelled to reinvent the wheel, but we should work together and use the great wheels others have created as a foundation for a brand new product. All of these ideas have driven me to become a much more refined and resourceful web developer.</p>
					<h4>LOOKING FORWARD</h4>
					<p>I look at my future with a big grin. Excited to meet and work with other programmers, designers, and directors. Eager to discover what new trends and technologies I should know and learn. My appetite for learning new languages has grown. I see myself bridging the gap between the designer and the programmer. I look forward to transcending my skills within a company and get a feel about the business side of web development. I am ready to further my career and some day become Chief Technology Officer of a big company.</p>
