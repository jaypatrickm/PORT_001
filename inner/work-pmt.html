			<p>The container full of moving containers!! Putting everything together was challenging. It contained a moving container of divs that each had their own sets of movement.</p>
			<p>The prototype was intended for use with an ipad.</p>
			<p>This was the first time I created something with so much moving animation. I was concerned with the amount of processing and loading everything would create because each inner container is an iframe of a new set of HTML. My experience at this point taught me to minimize the amount of code as much as possible and keep my code clear and organized because I was not the only person that would be working on it. I also used Velocity JS in some applications to improve speed.</p>
			<p>My team had previously created the grid container sizes and where they would move. I created the HTML, CSS animations for each movement and the timing through Javascript.</p>
			<p>Every inner container is its own html because each exists as their own application inside the Insteo database. The applications are tied to an account within Insteo's CMS. You log in and customize the different parts of the layout; you could change colors, text, and images.</p> 
			<p>For each application, I built the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. Either from scratch or using a plugin that my team had found to do what the client wanted. The javascripts contained code that would make an ajax call to the database and retrieve the custom infomation and send it over back as JSON data. I then used JQuery to apply the new custom attributes to the original HTML and CSS.</p>
			<p>The Javascript code I built included timing for when the CSS animations would fire, pause animations when in use and resume animations when idle, switching which social media would show, applying Hammer JS for touch movement, pop up modal of inner pages, attaching Date JS, attaching and implementing Velocity JS for smoother animations, and different versions of the AJAX call and JQuery custom styles application.</p>
			<p>Overall, I think the prototype was built as best as it could be given the short amount of time and the fact that we were pulling together a bunch of different iframes to move smoothly on an ipad. I really thank Velocity JS for existing for this project.</p>
