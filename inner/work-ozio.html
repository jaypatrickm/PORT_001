			<p>The Ozio touch was a prototype touch companion for Ozio's line of massage chairs. They asked Insteo to create an entertainment and point of purchase application that would be on a screen adjacent to the chair. There was not a lot of design and input from the client so I was left to make a lot of the design decisions as well as programming choices.</p>
			<p>I was particularly excited about this project because I really wanted to try and use flat design. I thought flat design would be a good feel for a touch application because it would look soft to touch. I also loved the idea of creating themes so that the user could change the background and colors. I researched some designs and landed with this gray and white combination. My initial designs had multiple colors and not just the green, but I did not have enough time to implement what I originally had in mind.</p>
			<p>I used Animate CSS to create the smooth transitions when buttons were pressed.</p>
			<p>I fell into some trouble with my design because we weren't sure about where we were going to generate the content from and I was pressed on time. I also had difficulties implementing two instances of the JPlayer. I was able to make it play music or videos, but I could not get it to stop one if the other was playing. It was my first time really working with this plugin and I was still a newbie at all of this stuff.</p>
			<p>Aside from the JPlayer addition, in Javascript I programmed a timer for starting the application and I used JQuery to fire all the animations and theme changing.</p>
			<p>The top ad slider is a recoded Insteo application connected to their database for showing ads from a content group in their database.</p>
